  <p>This is an open source series of organized, high quality datasets ready to go for machine learning use! The dinosaur dataset series will parse a dataset for you to use, show you how to use it, and you can do awesome research with it. Instructions for use are provided with each dataset, and you can expect more detail as we develop our first datasets. For now, please post questions and issues <a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch/datasets/issues" target="_blank">here</a>, and we look forward to sharing our first dinosaur dataset with you!</p>
